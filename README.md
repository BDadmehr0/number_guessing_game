# Number Guessing Game

## Overview
A simple number guessing game with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python's `tkinter` library. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the game provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. If the guess is correct, the game congratulates the player and resets for a new round.

## Features
- **Random Number Generation**: Generates a new random number between 1 and 100 each round.
- **Guess Feedback**: Provides hints on whether the guess is too high or too low.
- **Attempts Counter**: Tracks the number of guesses for each round.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the user's input is an integer within the valid range.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **tkinter** (usually included with Python installations)

## How to Run
1. Save the code as `guess_number_gui.py`.
2. Run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python guess_number_gui.py
